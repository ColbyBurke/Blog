          JRS Coding School Day Ten
        </h2>

        <p>
          Today is Friday, the tenth day of JRS, and we are wrapping things up for the week and working on our projects.
          This week we learned some things about APIs and im pretty familiar with how to use them at this point. Along
          with that we’ve been downloading and messing around with npms (Node Package Manager) and node.js. At this
          point I only have 6 more problems to do of the 84 we were assigned in order to be two weeks ahead. The
          practice problems seem somewhat easy for the most part, but some were harder than others. Recursion is
          becoming much more simple for me, however, our “mob” programming styled group assignment presented a challenge
          because it was difficult to sync our ideas with our typing. Our assignment has to do with recursion and we are
          not allowed to use any type of loops.

          JRS Coding School Day Six
        </h2>

        <p> Since I did a lot of my pending projects on the weekend, today was a breeze. We started off reviewing basic
          functions and what happens on the call stack and in memory when we call functions. It gave me a clearer
          understanding of what happens during recursion. After going through a few problems and seeing what happens to
          our hardware, we continued on to learn about high-order functions, something I’m already quite familiar with.
          That being said, the exercise for today was easy. We were supposed to use high-order functions on our existing
          functions, something which I had already done. The thing which I enjoy least at this point is HTML/CSS, but
          it’s obviously necessary.
