        <p>
          Since today is Friday, the fifth day of JRS, we took much of the day to work on our current projects. We have
          practice problems, websites, and projects (such as the calculator project) which need to be completed. The
          calculator has taken up much of my time this week because when I fix one problem in the JavaScript, often
          times another problem will appear. By now, the calculator looks good and does what I want it to. Other than
          those projects, we began to speak about the REST API, Bootstrap, jQuery, and databases. I know how to program,
          but I haven’t seen some of the stuff on the backend which we will talk about next week, so I’m excited to see
          what will happen.

        <p>
          Since our first day on Monday, we’ve touched on HTML/CSS as well as JavaScript. Of the three ways to code, I
          can
          definitely say that JavaScript is my favorite so far given my preparation. I would say that without
          preparation
          before the class started, I may have fallen behind. What’s interesting is the different ways in which you can
          code JavaScript. While we are just learning loops and styles of coding which is more basic, I tend to simplify
          functions with the use of other high-order functions. My presentation was today, thursday, and was about
          iteration and recursion. I explained to the class that while I understand how to both make and use recursive
          functions, the way it interacts with the call stack still remains a bit out-of-the-ordinary for me. Since
          Monday, we’ve started on several projects and practice problems. The JavaScript problems were fairly easy for
          me; 29 functions ranging from: easy, medium, to more difficult. I finished a functioning calculator which I am
          just beginning to link to my functions in a JavaScript file, and have multiple other HTML and CSS projects
          which
          I’ve uploaded to GitHub.

          JRS Coding School Day One
        </h2>

        <p>
          After a few months of scrambling through practice problems for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, JRS Coding School
          has
          started as of today. Before the class began, I had already acquired my JavaScript skills badge on LinkedIn and
          have
          been eager to see what lies ahead as far as how to implement with the language in combination with servers and
          web
          pages in general. While much of what we learned today had been review, I learned valuable concepts such as the
          “tree” data structure with its nodes and their parent-to-children assembly. On the topic of assembly, we also
          learned the assembly of a computer’s hardware and how that matters to us as programmers. It sparked curiosity
          about
          the jobs of compilers and assemblers when it comes to breaking down code into binary, or numbers (1s and 0s)
          representing electrical signals on which the computer runs. We looked at other basic things such as HTML tags
          and
          attributes, a little bit of JavaScript, Git and GitHub, and bash commands. In the days ahead I’ll be working
          on
          a
          presentation explaining the necessity of both iteration and recursion in our JavaScript, which I’m excited to
          do
          given that recursion had presented a challenge to me when first starting JavaScript.
