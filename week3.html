                    Since today is Friday, the fifth day of JRS, we took much of the day to work on our current
                    projects. We have
                    practice problems, websites, and projects (such as the calculator project) which need to be
                    completed. The
                    calculator has taken up much of my time this week because when I fix one problem in the JavaScript,
                    often
                    times another problem will appear. By now, the calculator looks good and does what I want it to.
                    Other than
                    those projects, we began to speak about the REST API, Bootstrap, jQuery, and databases. I know how
                    to program,
                    but I haven’t seen some of the stuff on the backend which we will talk about next week, so I’m
                    excited to see
                    what will happen.

                <p>
                    Since our first day on Monday, we’ve touched on HTML/CSS as well as JavaScript. Of the three ways to
                    code, I
                    can
                    definitely say that JavaScript is my favorite so far given my preparation. I would say that without
                    preparation
                    before the class started, I may have fallen behind. What’s interesting is the different ways in
                    which you can
                    code JavaScript. While we are just learning loops and styles of coding which is more basic, I tend
                    to simplify
                    functions with the use of other high-order functions. My presentation was today, thursday, and was
                    about
                    iteration and recursion. I explained to the class that while I understand how to both make and use
                    recursive
                    functions, the way it interacts with the call stack still remains a bit out-of-the-ordinary for me.
                    Since
                    Monday, we’ve started on several projects and practice problems. The JavaScript problems were fairly
                    easy for
                    me; 29 functions ranging from: easy, medium, to more difficult. I finished a functioning calculator
                    which I am
                    just beginning to link to my functions in a JavaScript file, and have multiple other HTML and CSS
                    projects
                    which
                    I’ve uploaded to GitHub.

                    JRS Coding School Day Eleven
                </h2>

                <p> Today is Monday, the eleventh day of JRS, and things are starting to get interesting for me. We
                    began the day with an introduction to promises. From there we worked on the APIs in a different way.
                    We did multiple practice exercises on the resolve and reject properties of the promise objects and
                    fetched APIs, turning the into promise objects themselves. Once the APIs were fetched, we worked on
                    displaying the results through that. Promise objects were not difficult for me to understand,
                    despite having heard about how difficult they were to read and manipulate.
