        JRS Coding School Day One
      </h1>

      <p>
        After a few months of scrambling through practice problems for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, JRS Coding School has
        started as of today. Before the class began, I had already acquired my JavaScript skills badge on LinkedIn and
        have
        been eager to see what lies ahead as far as how to implement with the language in combination with servers and
        web
        pages in general. While much of what we learned today had been review, I learned valuable concepts such as the
        “tree” data structure with its nodes and their parent-to-children assembly. On the topic of assembly, we also
        learned the assembly of a computer’s hardware and how that matters to us as programmers. It sparked curiosity
        about
        the jobs of compilers and assemblers when it comes to breaking down code into binary, or numbers (1s and 0s)
        representing electrical signals on which the computer runs. We looked at other basic things such as HTML tags
        and
        attributes, a little bit of JavaScript, Git and GitHub, and bash commands. In the days ahead I’ll be working on
        a
        presentation explaining the necessity of both iteration and recursion in our JavaScript, which I’m excited to do
        given that recursion had presented a challenge to me when first starting JavaScript.
